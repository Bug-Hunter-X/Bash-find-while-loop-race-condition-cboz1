This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition in a bash script that uses `find` with a `while` loop to process files. The script intends to iterate through all files found by `find`, but due to how the loop is constructed, it can be vulnerable if multiple instances of the script are run simultaneously, or if the script is called concurrently.  The `bug.sh` file shows the flawed code, and `bugSolution.sh` provides a corrected version that avoids the race condition.
